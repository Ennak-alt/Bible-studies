An expression becomes a statment when it is followed by a semicolon. The semicolon is a statement
terminator, rather than a separator. Braces are used to group declarations and statemnst together
into a compound statement, or bloc, so they are syntactically equivalen to a single statement.

It's a good idea to use braces hwen there is bany nested ifs, because the compiler might not recognize
what else should be with what if. Therefore is is a good idea to use braced when this is the case.
